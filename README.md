# 🏦 Banking Information System

This project is a **console-based Banking Information System**, implemented in **both Java and Python** as part of the Core Java and Python Internship Program under UCT (Upskill Campus Technology). It enables users to create accounts, log in securely, and perform various banking operations such as deposits, withdrawals, balance checks, and transfers.

## 📂 How to Run the Project

### ▶️ Java Version
1. Open a terminal in the project directory.
2. Compile the file:
   ```
   javac BankingInformationSystem.java
   ```
3. Run the program:
   ```
   java BankingInformationSystem
   ```

### 🐍 Python Version
1. Open terminal or VS Code and navigate to the project directory.
2. Run the script:
   ```
   python banking_information_system.py
   ```

⚠️ If `userdata.txt` does not exist, it will be created automatically.

---

## 📌 Exception Handling

Both versions handle file-related exceptions:
- If `userdata.txt` is **not found**, the program will **create it automatically**.
- All inputs are validated for correctness.
- Appropriate error messages are shown to guide the user.
